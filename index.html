Another on the right has one eye shut tight and the other with an eyeball sliding from the socket. The third ghost above the lock has empty eye sockets and sharp teeth with a large smile.

                        <p style="text-align: left;"><b>[ Your Mode of Practice ]</b></p>
                        <p style="text-align: left; padding-bottom: 50px">My Mode of Practice is
                            - "I'm not a problem." -
                             "All Seeing" (Drafts to the right.)</p>

                             <p style="text-align: left;"><b>[ Your Method ]</b></p>
                             <p style="text-align: left; padding-bottom: 50px">My method is simple. I record what I see, and I do whatever I can to fix it.</p>

                             <p style="text-align: left;"><b>[ Your Reasoning ]</b></p>
                             <p style="text-align: left; padding-bottom: 50px">I chose this
                            because I like black art (and I love black media, so why wouldn't I?)</p>

                            <p style="text-align: left;"><b>[ The Greater Context ]</b></p>
                            <p style="text-align: left; padding-bottom: 50px">The greater context of analysis is the interaction of these two major themes: power and context. When viewed as a series of interconnected pieces, "Black media theory" describes the construction of a digital black media theory of representation theory. Each piece is a digital ink illustration of (often displeased) faces, monsters, planets, and machines, coloured and distorted using their own Instagram interaction data.</p>

                            <p style="text-align: left;"><b>[ Why You Do This ]</b></p>
                            <p style="text-align: left; padding-bottom: 50px">I'm doing this because
                            I'm not rich.
                            I'm not famous.
                            I'm not famous (at risk of being "the famous")
                            In summary : If my blackness, in all it's glory, upsets you, THAT'S ON YOU. I'm not carrying that shxt.</p>

                            <p style="text-align: left;"><b>[ Are you the Artist? ]</b></p>
                            <p style="text-align: left; padding-bottom: 50px">I am the artist that scribbled this comic.</p>
